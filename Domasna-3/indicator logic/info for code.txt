Indicators
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SMA: Simple Moving Average

SMA calculates the average of the prices over a period

Rule: If the current price is above the SMA, the trend is bullish (suggest to invest). 
If it’s below, the trend is bearish (suggest to avoid or sell).
Why: SMA reflects the average price over a period, helping to identify long-term trends.

It calculates the average price of an asset over a specific time period 
(e.g., 50-day, 200-day). Each price point within that period is treated equally, 
meaning the formula simply adds up all the prices and divides by the number of data points.

Why It Works: The SMA helps identify long-term trends. 
Since it’s calculated using an average, it smooths out short-term price fluctuations, 
making it effective for detecting broader market movements (upward or downward).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMA: Exponential Moving Average

EMA is similar to SMA but gives more importance to recent prices, reacting faster to price changes.

Rule: Use the EMA for shorter-term trend analysis. If the EMA crosses above the SMA (a "golden cross"), it’s a buy signal. If it crosses below (a "death cross"), it’s a sell signal.
Why: EMA reacts faster to recent price changes.

It is similar to the SMA but places more weight on recent prices. 
This makes it more sensitive to recent price changes and quicker to respond to market 
movements.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WMA: Weighted Moving Average

WMA assigns different weights to prices, with more weight given to newer prices.

Rule: Similar to EMA, but more sensitive. Confirm trends detected by EMA or SMA.
Why: WMA can fine-tune your analysis for volatile stocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VWMA: Volume-Weighted Moving Average

VWMA uses both prices and trading volumes to calculate the average. It gives more weight to prices with higher trading volumes.

Rule: If the price is rising along with VWMA, it indicates strong momentum (invest). If VWMA diverges (price rises, but VWMA doesn’t), it signals weak support for the trend (avoid).
Why: VWMA incorporates volume, which adds credibility to price movements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HMA: Hull Moving Average

HMA is a faster and smoother moving average designed to reduce lag

Rule: Use HMA to identify trend reversals quickly. If the HMA curve turns upward, it’s a potential buy signal. If it turns downward, consider avoiding or selling.
Why: HMA is smoother and faster at detecting changes.

Oscillators
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use oscillators to help identify is a asset is overbought or oversold.
It strengths what we see in the indicators and confirm when trends are going up or down.


RSI: Relative Strength Index - Measures the speed and change of price movements.
Ranges from 0 to 100, with overbought above 70 and oversold below 30.

RSI calculates the average of gains and losses over the period.

Formula:

averageCalculated=(average gain/average loss)
RSI=100-(100/(1+averageCalculated))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stochastic Oscillator - Compares the closing price to its price range over a specific period.
Ranges between 0 and 100, with overbought above 80 and oversold below 20.

Formula:

Current Close - The last price at which the asset was traded during the current time period
Lowest Low - The lowest price recorded during the specific lookback period (e.g., 14 days)
Highest High - The highest price recorded during the specific lookback period

(current close-lowest low) : This calculates how far the current closing price is above the lowest price of the time period.

(highest high-lowest low)  : This represents the full price range (the distance between the highest and lowest prices) over the specified time period.

*Dividing the numerator by the denominator gives the position of the current price within the range.
By multiplying the result by 100 we scale it to a range of 0 - 100 so we have a normalized way of identifying trends

%D - smooths the %K values using a Simple Moving Average (SMA), which helps identify trends and reduces noise.

How it works: last three values of %K and find their average. 


%K=((current close-lowest low)/(highest high-lowest low)) * 100

%D=SMA of %K

1. if %K>80 or %D>80 the asset is overbought
2. if %K<20 or %D<20 the asset is oversold
3. When %K crosses above %D, it indicates upward momentum, suggesting a buy opportunity
4. When %K crosses below %D, it indicates downward momentum, suggesting a sell opportunity

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence - Based on the relationship between two EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages).
Oscillates around a centerline (0).

Formula:

EMAs - short-term. This is a faster-moving average that responds more quickly to price changes
EMAl - long-term. This is a slower-moving average that reacts more slowly to price changes

*If thr short-term EMA is above the long-term one it suggest a good buying opportunity, but if it's presenting the other way around it suggest a selling opportunity.

MACD Line=EMAs−EMAl 

Signal Line=EMA of MACD Line

EMA_today=((Value_today - EMA_yesterday)/k)+EMA_yesterday


Value_today: MACD value for the current day

k: the smoothing constant

k=2/(N+1) where N is the period we need to calculate

MACD Histogram=MACD Line - Signal Line

*if the MACD is above the Signal Line this suggest a good buy opportunity. 
So if MACD Histogram is positive it's good, but if it's negative (Signal Line is above MACD Line) then it suggest a sell opportunity


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome Oscillator - Measures momentum by comparing a short-term SMA to a longer-term SMA

Formula:

EMAs - short-term. 
EMAl - long-term.


Median Price= (High Price+Low Price)/2 this represents the midpoint between the highest and lowest prices for each period (used for ema)

​
AO=SMAs−SMAl 
​

Ultimate Oscillator - Combines short, medium, and long-term momentum into one value to reduce sensitivity to short-term price fluctuations and give a more comprehensive view of price momentum. 
It is designed to measure buying pressure and selling pressure over different periods, giving traders a more accurate assessment of market momentum.

Formula: 

BP - Buying Pressure measures the price movement relative to the previous period's low
Low - the current period's low price
Previous Close - the close price from the previous period
Close - the current periods close price

BP=Close−min(Low,Previous Close)

TR - True Range is the measure of volatility for each period, considering the highest and lowest points of the current period as well as the previous period’s close.
High- current period high price

TR=max(High,Previous Close)−min(Low,Previous Close)


UO= 100 * ((A1 * 4 + A2 *2 + A3)/4+2+1)

* How weighten average of BP works. It is for giving different importance to recent price actions versus longer-term price actions, based on their relevance to current market conditions.
So short-term BP is weighted by 4, medium-term by 2 and long-term by 1.

*4+2+1 is called a Total weight. Which combines all of the weights that are put on the BP

A - average

A1=BP short-term / TR short-term
A2=BP medium-term / TR medium-term
A3=BP long-term / TR long-term



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Williams %R -  momentum oscillator that measures the level of the close relative to the highest high and lowest low over a given period (usually 14 periods). 
It helps traders identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market, signaling potential trend reversals.


%R=((Highest High -Close)/(Highest High- Lowest Low)) * - 100

1) 0 to -20: Overbought zone. The market is likely due for a correction or reversal downward.
2) -80 to -100: Oversold zone. The market is likely due for a bounce or reversal upward.
3) -20 to -80: Neutral zone, indicating a stable or unclear trend.

Logic:
We have 3 base cases: Buy, Hold and Sell.
bullish- to buy
bearish- to not buy, but to sell


*We can calculate the trends by using: 
trend_up = (price > sma and price > ema and price > wma and price > vwma and price > hma). These are the perfect conditions to buy any stock
trend_down = (price < sma and price < ema and price < wma and price < vwma and price < hma). These are the conditions where it is advised to not buy any stock, but to sell possible stock

*We can calculate if the stock is oversold or overbought using:
oversold=(rsi<30andstochastic<20andwilliams_r<−80)
overbought=(rsi>70andstochastic>80andwilliams_r>−20)


*Calculating Oscillators for later use
macd_bullish = (macd > macd_signal)
macd_bearish = (macd < macd_signal)

ao_positive = (awesome_oscillator > 0)
ao_negative = (awesome_oscillator < 0)

wr_bullish=(williams_r < -80)
wr_bearish=(williams_r < -20)



*Basic Decision Logic:
if trend_up and oversold and macd_bullish and ao_positive and wr_bullish it is the strongest signal to buy buy buy stock,
but if trend_down and overbought and macd_bearish and ao_negative and wr_bearish then it is suggested to sell the stock.

But we also have a hold option where the client is advised if they should: 
A) Hold for an upword move in trens or a Good Hold (name still in workshop)
b) Hold because the trend is weakening and going down. Client advised to prepare to sell stock. Bad Hold
C) Hold to see where the stock goes. It is in a stable place but no clear signes as to if it's going in a positive or negatove way. Neutral Hold

A) Conditions for a good hold
if short_ma > long_ma and macd_histogram > 0 and ao_positive and wr_bullish

B)Conditions for a bad hold
if short_ma < long_ma and macd_histogram < 0 and ao_negative and wr_bullish

C)Conditions for a neutral hold
the previous conditions are not met so it is rolled into a nutral position in the trend cycle
